# Library-management-system
This is an application or system that will enable learners access learning material online. The system will allow borrowing, return, check new learning materials and due dates online, also some of the learning materials can be downloaded online.


Problem Statement
A lot of libraries are operated manually by librarians. They have a bigger task of keeping all records regarding transactions of books and other learning materials. Are also supposed to keep details of the learners or staff who come to borrow or return books and any library material .Any learner or staff who wants to borrow learning material from the library must give his/her details in full such school id,id number,regestration number,telephone number,email address and many more details.All this process is carried out manually in the library.When some libraries are large,the process is slow and tend to take long hours.When a student goes to the library to borrow or return a book he or she gets other students on queue waiting to be served by the library attendant.He or she is forced to wait for more than an hour so that others are cleared.This makes the students loose alot while waiting to be attended to.The books to be borrowed are also manually arranged to their respective shelves.Also books that are returned to the library are also arranged back to the shelves where they are supposed to be. If you want to borrow a book, first you have to provide valid identification. After handing it over to the librarian, you will now go directly to the shelves where you will manually search for the book you want to borrow. Sometimes you may not actually get the book you intended to borrow because either the book was misplaced,the book was borrowed and it had not been returned back or the book got lost but the library management have not provided information on that.Sometimes students misplace or loose their school id and therefore accessing the library without school id becomes a problem. You may also go to the library to borrow a book and find that the book you intended to borrow is not available and the librarian is not fully aware. This actually discourages number of students from coming to the library. When new books are are brought to the library, it takes long for students to get the information so that they can borrow those new books. Also students forget the due date of returning the book he or she borrowed something that attracts fine if the book is not returned on time. Also the problem of space consuming erupts after the number of records becomes large the space for physical storage of file and records increases thus increasing cost of managing it. This project proposed the creation of online library app that help learners borrow/return books online, get notification of new books, get notification of due dates of returning a book online and also enable easy and fast generation of reports retrieval of data.
